# Downtime
## What is it?
The key idea behind Downtime is marrying ambient sound with the physical space in which it was recorded. While the functionality to upload prerecorded sound exists, the intended use case is that sound will be recorded outdoors and then listened to and appreciated indoors. My goal with this project is to be able to capture and relive some version of the mindful introspection that comes with spending time alone outdoors.
Downtime is by all means a work in progress, yet certain features which may appear not yet implemented are absent by design. Most notably is user interaction by way of likes and follows. These features may be relatively straight forward to add but I feel there is no real reason to do so. Downtime was never intended to be a form of social media but rather a respite from such things.

## Ok so what is it actually?
Downtime is a web app where you can record and upload sound, explore sounds on a map, create playlists, playback sounds, and add sound effects of your choosing.

## How to run it?
The `dev` command will run a local instance, provided Ruby, Rails, and dependencies are installed.

## What have I learned so far?
So far this project has been an exercise in pragmatism and restraint. Not reinventing the wheel, implementing simple solutions well, and planning things out properly before building.

## Ok sure but what have I actually learned?
I have learned a lot about the Web Audio API and still have a lot more to learn about it. I have learned about capturing audio and geolocation. I am learning about what to test and how to test it.
